- I am a "junior" at Colorado State University pursuing a second degree in Computer Engineering with an emphasis in Embedded Systems and a minor in Computer Science.
- I am part of CSU's Canine Exoskeleton group working to develop treatment-oriented prostheses for dogs.
- When not studying, I enjoy spending time with my spouse and our miniature poodle, TJ, and playing roller derby.
